Webinar was overall good and the best speaker was of course rishav bhaiya. Through this webinar i finally got to learn about github and about the pull requests. i had earlier done pull request but at that time i knew nothing about it.
At some places the sound was lagging but its totally ok as net har jagah ek jaisa kaam thodi krta h.Thanks Dhaval bhaiya for letting me know about ths.
